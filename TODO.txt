* Make smarter parser, remove "if course in line", instead split the line into items and check the dict for these items

* Need a regex for (d+\.d)_ ([3,4,5,G]) in order to find he grade, where (d+\.d) is the courses HP.
    A complication is that the grade is not always listed at the same position as the course.
    A need for a semi "smart" approach is thus needed. Fx, try to match each listed grade with the first course
    that has the same amount of HP, and then present the data to the user and ask "is this correct?".
    Wish there were a better way... not a fan of scraping a PDF...

    m = re.match("(\d+\.\d)_ ([345G])", str)

* Add demo mode

* Scrape PDF for name
